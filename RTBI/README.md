# RTBI Module (Real-Time Business Intelligence)

## Description
The `RTBI` module is designed to consume and process JSON data in real time via Kafka. It enables live analysis of incoming events and streams real-time data to subscribed clients via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Key Features
- Consumes JSON data from a Kafka topic.
- Calculates real-time statistics from incoming events.
- Streams data to clients using SSE.

## Configuration
- **Kafka Consumer:** Configure Kafka consumer settings in the `application.properties` file. This includes broker connection details and consumer-specific parameters.

## Getting Started
The `RTBI` module requires Kafka brokers to be running.

1. Make sure Kafka instances are up and running in Docker, as described in the [main Petzi project README](https://github.com/Jonathanngamboe/petzi).
2. Verify that Docker containers are running properly.
3. To launch the `RTBI` module, run the `RtbiApplication.java` class. This starts the Kafka consumer, initializes SSE, and begins processing data in real time.

## Usage
The `RTBI` module operates primarily in the background by continuously consuming and processing data from Kafka. Logs and alerts generated by the system serve as the main interface for users and downstream systems.

To subscribe to real-time data, clients can connect to the SSE endpoint:
```
http://localhost:8082/rtbi/sse
```
